                <h2>Why should We help poor people?</h2>
                <p>A lot of people think to make a donation and they do it. Many think what will I get in return if I help others. You might also wonder what the benefits of helping the poor are. Well, it is all about helping someone in living a better life and achieving his/her dreams. You can be like a god for somebody by offering a very little fraction of your wealth.

                    You can play a very important role in someone’s life if you help that person in getting better education. This world needs more and more good people who can do good deeds to support others in improving their lifestyle. You do not need to spend millions of dollars; a few hundred bucks can also work to bring smile on many kids’ faces.</p>
                    <h2>What are the benefits of helping the poor?</h2>
                    <p>Millions of people are starving and forced to live a life in the absence of basic amenities. They do not have food, clothes, and homes to live safe and healthy. Whatever caused this situation, these people are humans and it is your primary responsibility to help as many as you can.

                        It is not just about helping poor but also about saving kids and adults from choosing ways which are unethical. A number of criminals forced were forced to do what is illegal and harmful for others. You can take an initiative to prevent kids and other from walking on that road. You can save somebody’s life by making a donation that can help people in gaining basic amenities.</p>
